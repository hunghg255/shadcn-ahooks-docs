## Overview

- `useRequest` is a powerful React hook for managing data fetching and state in your applications. It simplifies the process of making API requests, handling loading states, caching, and error management, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than boilerplate code.

## Usage

# Quick Start

`useRequest` is a powerful Hooks for asynchronous data management. `useRequest` is sufficient enough for network request scenarios in React projects.

`useRequest` organizes code through a plug-in pattern, the core code is extremely simple, and can be easily extended for more advanced features. Current features include:

- Automatic/manual request
- Polling
- Debounce
- Throttle
- Refresh on window focus
- Error retry
- Loading delay
- SWR(stale-while-revalidate)
- Caching

Next, let's get to know `useRequest` from the two simplest examples.

## Default usage

The first parameter of `useRequest` is an asynchronous function, which will be automatically triggered when the component is first loaded. At the same time, it automatically manages the status of `loading`, `data`, `error` of the asynchronous function.

```js
const { data, error, loading } = useRequest(getUsername);
```

<br />

<code src="./demo/default.tsx" />

## Manual trigger

If `options.manual = true` is set, useRequest will not be executed by default, and the execution needs to be triggered by `run`.

```js
const { loading, run } = useRequest(changeUsername, {
  manual: true
});
```

<br />

<code src="./demo/manual.tsx" />

In the above two examples, we demonstrated the most basic usages of `useRequest`. Next, we will introduce the features of `useRequest` one by one.
