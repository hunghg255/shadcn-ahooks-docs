## Overview

A hook implements with `requestAnimationFrame` for better performance. The API is consistent with `useTimeout`. the advantage is that will not trigger function when the page is not rendering, such as page hiding or minimization.

> `requestAnimationFrame` will automatically downgrade to `setTimeout` in node environment
