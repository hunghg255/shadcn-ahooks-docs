`useCreation` is the replacement for `useMemo` or `useRef`.

`useMemo` can't guarantee the memoized value will not be recalculated, while `useCreation` can guarantee that. As the the official document of React.js says:

> **You may rely on useMemo as a performance optimization, not as a semantic guarantee.** In the future, React may choose to “forget” some previously memoized values and recalculate them on next render, e.g. to free memory for offscreen components. Write your code so that it still works without `useMemo` — and then add it to optimize performance.

And similar to `useRef`, you can use `useCreation` to create some constants. But `useCreation` can avoid performance hazards.

```javascript
const a = useRef(new Subject()); // A new Subject instance is created in every render.
const b = useCreation(() => new Subject(), []); // By using factory function, Subject is only instantiated once.
```

## Examples

### Default usage


<Preview name="useCreation"
 code={`
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import useCreation from '@/src/hooks/ahooks/useCreation';

class Foo {
  constructor() {
    this.data = Math.random();
  }

  data: number;
}

const Example = () => {
  const foo = useCreation(() => new Foo(), []);
  const [, setFlag] = useState({});
  return (
    <>
      <p>{foo.data}</p>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => {
          setFlag({});
        }}
      >
        Rerender
      </button>
    </>
  );
};

export default Example;`} />
